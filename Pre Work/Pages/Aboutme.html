	<h3> About Me </h3>
	<div id="description">
		<p> Coming from a background with many family members in the creative arts it was only natural that some of that passed down to me. Starting every Halloween, Christmas, and celebration from a young age I designed and picked out fabrics I wanted in the dresses I would be wearing. With help from my Grandmother the dresses I wanted were created and my love for design and sewing continued throughout highschool and college. Between studying and choosing majors/minors and potential future goals, design remained, sketchbooks and computer folderrs filled up with themed gowns, costumes, and garments of every kind. Thereafter, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Forensic Psychology but decided to pursue design. From the traditional fashion design, computer designs, creating presentations, and preparing an all digital portfolio, reintroducing me to web design. This site will focus on the Fashion and Costume designs throughout the years. From the use of paper to digital artwork, old and new. </p>
